# Remote Working Experiment

> ***Remote***: *(of a place) situated far from the main centres of population; distant*.

## Why?

***Forcing people*** to **sit** at a **desk** in an **office** between a **pre-determined** start and end **time** is ***obsolete***.
**Requiring people** to be ***physically*** **present** at an office is a ***relic*** of
an era in which ***people were not trusted to get work done without "supervision"***.

The mindset of everyone having to "[*clock-in*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_attendance)" before a certain time (e.g: 09:00) each day is a remnant of the industrial revolution when it was the easiest way
to keep track of (and thus pay) people. But today we have ***much better*** ways of measuring the output of people that is **not dependent** on **where** they are or **when** the work is done.

### Is the *best* person/people for the Job in the same city as your office?

Restricting the group of people you can select from (to perform a task) to a geographic region such as a city (*where traditional offices are located*)
is like limiting yourself to only having relationships with people in the your neighborhood. Imagine if we could only select potential friends/spouces from a pre-defined list e.g: the town you grew up in. (*Sadly, this is still the [reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranged_marriage) for many people, but that's a whole other story!*) For many of us, this is *unthinkable*; go on any social network and count how many of your ("*real*") friends are from the same town you were born in. And yet this is *exactly* what companies/organisations do every day when they limit themselves to selecting people who *already* live the city where their office is.

Doesn't it make sense for the ***whole world*** to be your ***potential team***?

### Does your existing team's hiring *discriminate* against anyone?

Remote working allows us to find/pick the ***best*** people for a project/task irrespective of location/time-zone but a little known benefit is that it also helps to minimize other discrimination on the basis of gender, ethnicity, faith or disability.

We have selected people for tasks based on their (*proven*) ability to get the work done. By not forcing people to commute away from their family, new parents can get work done and still spend quality time with their children (instead of of wasting 2 hours each day on transport/traffic!)

### Are the people suck in an office motivated to get their work done?

The *productive* office is the *exception* not the rule. Offices are great for catching up with your colleagues but *statistically* not the place people go to get their best work done.

Watch Jason Fried: Why ***work doesn't happen at work***:

and if you don't identify with what he is saying, close this window and enjoy the rest of your day.  
For the rest of us who have felt the pain of working in a noisy environment where constant interruptions prevent meaningful progress, read on.

What if there was a better way to get work done?
